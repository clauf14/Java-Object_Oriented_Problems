# Java-Object_Oriented_Problems
Here are some exercises I made!<br>
Click on the folder name, after click on 𝙨𝙧𝙘 folder and after click on any program that you want to see!

𝟭. For project named 𝐬𝐭𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭_𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐬 : https://github.com/clauf14/Java-Object_Oriented_Problems/tree/main/student_exercises <br>
I have created 3 classes named: Grade, Student and TestStudent and they all help each other to reach an error-free result.
I also created "students" file, from where the information about the students is taken and with the help of which the arithmetic mean of all grades is calculated, and whether or not the students have resits. 
I also created a method that calculates the age of the person with the help of the CNP, automatically, using 𝙨𝙪𝙗𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜. <br><br>

𝟐. For project named 𝐠𝐞𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐜-𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐞_𝐢𝐧𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 : https://github.com/clauf14/Java-Object_Oriented_Problems/tree/main/geometric-figure_inheritance <br>
I used inheritance properties, with 𝙂𝙚𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙘𝙁𝙞𝙜𝙪𝙧𝙚 class being the superclass, and 𝘾𝙞𝙧𝙘𝙡𝙚 and 𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙜𝙡𝙚 being the subclasses. This program calculates the 𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙖 and the 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙢𝙚𝙩𝙚𝙧 of Circle and Rectangle. It counts if the object is 𝙧𝙚𝙙 and the 𝙞𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙘𝙚 𝙤𝙛 the object. Finally, the program 𝙨𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙨 the objects by 𝙖𝙧𝙚𝙖.

Run the programs and you will see what it displays! Thanks :)
