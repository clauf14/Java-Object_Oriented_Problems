For this project named student_exercises : https://github.com/clauf14/Java-Object_Oriented_Problems/tree/main/student_exercises <br>
I have created 3 classes named: Grade, Student and TestStudent and they all help each other to reach an error-free result. <br>
I also created "students" file, from where the information about the students is taken and with the help of which the<br> arithmetic mean of all grades is calculated, and whether or not the students have resits. 
I also created that calculates the age of the person with the help of the CNP, automatically, using 𝙨𝙪𝙗𝙨𝙩𝙧𝙞𝙣𝙜.
